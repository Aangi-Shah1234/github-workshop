git init
Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. It creates a hidden .git folder that stores all version control information.

git status
Displays the state of the working directory and staging area. It shows which changes have been staged, which haven’t, and which files aren’t being tracked by Git.

git add testing.py
Adds the file "testing.py" to the staging area, meaning it’s ready to be committed in the next version snapshot.

git rm testing.py
Removes the file "testing.py" from the working directory and staging area. The file is deleted from both Git and your local directory.

git restore testing.py
Restores the file "testing.py" from the last committed version. It discards changes made to the file since the last commit.
